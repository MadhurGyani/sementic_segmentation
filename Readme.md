# Satellite Imagery Change Detection

## Overview

This project aims to detect changes in greenery over time in satellite images of the same location. By preprocessing satellite imagery data and training a deep learning model, the project can compare images from different time periods and identify changes in vegetation.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- PIL (`Image`)
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow (for deep learning)
- Keras (for deep learning)
- segmentation_models (for model architecture)

## Installation

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
